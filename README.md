> **Lies. Clues. Chaos.**

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **One device, pass around** — no app needed for other players
2. Each player secretly views their role (Agent or Spy) and the secret word
3. Everyone takes turns giving one-word clues about the secret word
4. **Agents** try to expose the spy through discussion
5. **The Spy** tries to blend in without knowing the word
6. Vote to eliminate — if the spy is caught, agents win. If not, the spy wins!
